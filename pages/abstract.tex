Confidential Computing is a rising field in IT security. Applications and software is often run in untrusted environments without mechnisms to secure them from malicious entities. The goal of confidential computing is to protect the data in use through the use of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). One important concept to validate the authenticity and integrity of these TEEs, often run on separate systems, is called Remote Attestation. The Fraunhofer AISEC Institute developed a Universal Remote Attestation Framework to provide attestation for different confidential computing technologies as well as the establishment of a secure channel between different TEEs. The goal of this work is to enhance the functionality of the framework by integrating support for Intel SGX.
A concept was designed to enable integration within the framework and analyzed in terms of security. Furthermore specific drivers were implemented within the framework to generate and verify SGX attestation reports.
